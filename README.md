# Smash or Pass your [AniList](https://anilist.co)!

I didn't find any good websites allowing you to:

- use your own animelist
- allows sharing your results
- allows filtering by role
- and much more

... so I just made my own!

## Usage

### Playing

Just visit https://vertikarl.github.io/anilist-smashorpass/, enter your username and filters and begin smashing!

### Sharing

(Still very work in progress)  
After rating your animelist you might want to share your taste with your friends.  
No problem! Just click on the button share at the top and navigate to "Generate URL", clicking it redirects you to a new page.
The resulting URL in your browser is ready to be shared with friends!

### Issues

Is there something that bothers you and/or that doesn't work properly?  
Please report it over at the [issues](https://github.com/vertiKarl/anilist-smashorpass/issues) tab!

## Running locally

PRs are always welcome!

### Cloning

`git clone https://vertikarl.github.io/anilist-smashorpass.git`

### Dependencies

I prefer to use yarn:
`yarn install`  
If you instead want to use npm you are on your own.

### Build

First build the app:
`yarn build`
then run it: `yarn preview`

### Development

Run vite in development mode (including hotreload):
`yarn dev`
